instance.problem.max.length=String consists of ${actual} character(s) and is too long. It must have at most ${bound} character(s).
instance.problem.min.length=String consists of ${actual} character(s) and is too short. It must have at least ${bound} character(s).
instance.problem.exclusive.max.length=String consists of ${actual} character(s) and is too long. It must have less than ${bound} character(s).
instance.problem.exclusive.min.length=String consists of ${actual} character(s) and is too short. It must have more than ${bound} character(s).
instance.problem.maximum=Number ${actual} is too big, must be less than or equal to ${bound}.
instance.problem.minimum=Number ${actual} is too small, must be greater than or equal to ${bound}.
instance.problem.exclusive.maximum=Number ${actual} is too big, must be less than ${bound}.
instance.problem.exclusive.minimum=Number ${actual} is too small, must be greater than ${bound}.
instance.problem.type=${actual} type is not allowed. It must be any of ${expected}.
instance.problem.required=Required property is missing: ${expected}.

instance.problem.not.type=Type ${actual} is not allowed. It must be other than ${expected}.
instance.problem.not.required=Properties are too exhaustive. Any of ${expected} must be left out.

instance.problem.one.of=${actual} subschemas are satisfied, must be one.
instance.problem.unknown=Value is invalid for an unknown reason.
